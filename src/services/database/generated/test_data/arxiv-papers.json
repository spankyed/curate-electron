    "abstract": "Modern transportation planning relies heavily on accurate predictions of\nperson and vehicle trips. However, traditional planning models often fail to\naccount for the intricacies and dynamics of travel behavior, leading to\nless-than-optimal accuracy in these predictions. This study explores the\npotential of deep learning techniques to transform the way we approach trip\npredictions, and ultimately, transportation planning. Utilizing a comprehensive\ndataset from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we developed and\ntrained a deep learning model for predicting person and vehicle trips. The\nproposed model leverages the vast amount of information in the NHTS data,\ncapturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by\ntraditional models. As a result, our deep learning model achieved an impressive\naccuracy of 98% for person trip prediction and 96% for vehicle trip estimation.\nThis represents a significant improvement over the performances of traditional\ntransportation planning models, thereby demonstrating the power of deep\nlearning in this domain. The implications of this study extend beyond just more\naccurate predictions. By enhancing the accuracy and reliability of trip\nprediction models, planners can formulate more effective, data-driven\ntransportation policies, infrastructure, and services. As such, our research\nunderscores the need for the transportation planning field to embrace advanced\ntechniques like deep learning. The detailed methodology, along with a thorough\ndiscussion of the results and their implications, are presented in the\nsubsequent sections of this paper.",

Yet, a formidable bottleneck obstructs progress - the\nlaborious and time-intensive manual identification of intersections. Simply\nconsidering the shear number of intersections that need to be identified, and\nthe labor hours required per intersection, the need for an automated solution\nbecomes undeniable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages connected vehicle data and cutting-edge deep learning techniques. By\nemploying geohashing to segment vehicle trajectories and then generating image\nrepresentations of road segments, we utilize the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once\nversion 5) algorithm for accurate classification of both straight road segments\nand intersections. Experimental results demonstrate an impressive overall\nclassification accuracy of 95%, with straight roads achieving a remarkable 97%\nF1 score and intersections reaching a 90% F1 score. This approach not only\nsaves time and resources but also enables more frequent updates and a\ncomprehensive understanding of the road network. Our research showcases the\npotential impact on traffic management, urban planning, and autonomous vehicle\nnavigation systems. The fusion of connected vehicle data and deep learning\nmodels holds promise for a transformative shift in road infrastructure mapping,\npropelling us towards a smarter, safer, and more connected transportation\necosystem.",

However, a\nmajor challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on\nevaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and\nregulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs.\nTo address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key\ndimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness.

Besides the enormous challenge of perception, i.e. accurately\nperceiving the environment using available sensor data, automated driving\ncomprises planning a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To\npromote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future\nmotion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly\nhandle prediction and planning as sequential separate tasks. While this\naccounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego-vehicle, it fails\nto anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego-vehicle's\nbehavior. Recent works suggest that integrating prediction and planning in an\ninterdependent joint step is necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and\ncomfortable driving. While various models implement such integrated systems, a\ncomprehensive overview and theoretical understanding of different principles\nare lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based\nprediction, planning, and integrated prediction and planning models. Different\nfacets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to\nbehavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration\nmethods. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges,\nand highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions\nfor future research.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant interest in recent\nyears as a solution to address the challenges posed by sparse and noisy data in\nrecommender systems. Despite the growing number of SSL algorithms designed to\nprovide state-of-the-art performance in various recommendation scenarios (e.g.,\ngraph collaborative filtering, sequential recommendation, social\nrecommendation, KG-enhanced recommendation), there is still a lack of unified\nframeworks that integrate recommendation algorithms across different domains.\nSuch a framework could serve as the cornerstone for self-supervised\nrecommendation algorithms, unifying the validation of existing methods and\ndriving the design of new ones.

    "abstract": "Recently, methods for skeleton-based human activity recognition have been\nshown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, these attack methods\nrequire either the full knowledge of the victim (i.e. white-box attacks),\naccess to training data (i.e. transfer-based attacks) or frequent model queries\n(i.e. black-box attacks). All their requirements are highly restrictive,\nraising the question of how detrimental the vulnerability is. In this paper, we\nshow that the vulnerability indeed exists. To this end, we consider a new\nattack task: the attacker has no access to the victim model or the training\ndata or labels, where we coin the term hard no-box attack. Specifically, we\nfirst learn a motion manifold where we define an adversarial loss to compute a\nnew gradient for the attack, named skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient. Our\ngradient contains information of the motion dynamics, which is different from\nexisting gradient-based attack methods that compute the loss gradient assuming\neach dimension in the data is independent. The SMI gradient can augment many\ngradient-based attack methods, leading to a new family of no-box attack\nmethods. Extensive evaluation and comparison show that our method imposes a\nreal threat to existing classifiers. They also show that the SMI gradient\nimproves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial samples in\nboth no-box and transfer-based black-box settings.",

Existing MDR models face two challenges: First, it is difficult to\ndisentangle knowledge that generalizes across domains (e.g., a user likes cheap\nitems) and knowledge specific to a single domain (e.g., a user likes blue\nclothing but not blue cars). Second, they have limited ability to transfer\nknowledge across domains with small overlaps.

    "title": "Cross-heterogeneity Graph Few-shot Learning",
    "abstract": "In recent years, heterogeneous graph few-shot learning has been proposed to\naddress the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which contain\nvarious types of nodes and edges. The existing methods have achieved good\nperformance by transferring generalized knowledge extracted from rich-labeled\nclasses in source HG(s) to few-labeled classes in a target HG. However, these\nmethods only consider the single-heterogeneity scenario where the source and\ntarget HGs share a fixed set of node/edge types, ignoring the more general\nscenario of cross-heterogeneity, where each HG can have a different and\nnon-fixed set of node/edge types. To this end, we focus on the unexplored\ncross-heterogeneity scenario and propose a novel model for Cross-heterogeneity\nGraph Few-shot Learning, namely CGFL. In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns\nto capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous\ngraph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose\na score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine\nthe transferability of each source HG. Finally, by integrating MHGN and the\nscore module into a meta-learning mechanism, CGFL can effectively transfer\ngeneralized knowledge to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior\nperformance of CGFL over the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "This study performs an ablation analysis of Vector Quantized Generative\nAdversarial Networks (VQGANs), concentrating on image-to-image synthesis\nutilizing a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The current work explores the nuanced\neffects of varying critical parameters including the number of epochs, image\ncount, and attributes of codebook vectors and latent dimensions, specifically\nwithin the constraint of limited resources. Notably, our focus is pinpointed on\nthe vector quantization loss, keeping other hyperparameters and loss components\n(GAN loss) fixed. This was done to delve into a deeper understanding of the\ndiscrete latent space, and to explore how varying its size affects the\nreconstruction. Though, our results do not surpass the existing benchmarks,\nhowever, our findings shed significant light on VQGAN's behaviour for a smaller\ndataset, particularly concerning artifacts, codebook size optimization, and\ncomparative analysis with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The study also\nuncovers the promising direction by introducing 2D positional encodings,\nrevealing a marked reduction in artifacts and insights into balancing clarity\nand overfitting.",

    "title": "Leveraging the Edge and Cloud for V2X-Based Real-Time Object Detection in Autonomous Driving",
    "abstract": "Environmental perception is a key element of autonomous driving because the\ninformation received from the perception module influences core driving\ndecisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous\ndriving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and\nlatency. Major constraints on both computation and power have to be taken into\naccount for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger object\ndetection models tend to produce the best results, but are also slower at\nruntime. Since the most accurate detectors cannot run in real-time locally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud\nplatforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset\nto train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies.\nUsing real hardware and network simulations, we compare different trade-offs\nbetween prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Since sending raw frames over\nthe network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of\nJPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on\nprediction metrics. We show that models with adequate compression can be run in\nreal-time on the cloud while outperforming local detection performance.",

    "abstract": "While diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models provide a simple and\npowerful way to generate images, guiding this generation remains a challenge.\nFor concepts that are difficult to describe through language, users may\nstruggle to create prompts. Moreover, many of these models are built as\nend-to-end systems, lacking support for iterative shaping of the image. In\nresponse, we introduce PromptPaint, which combines T2I generation with\ninteractions that model how we use colored paints. PromptPaint allows users to\ngo beyond language to mix prompts that express challenging concepts. Just as we\niteratively tune colors through layered placements of paint on a physical\ncanvas, PromptPaint similarly allows users to apply different prompts to\ndifferent canvas areas and times of the generative process. Through a set of\nstudies, we characterize different approaches for mixing prompts, design\ntrade-offs, and socio-technical challenges for generative models. With\nPromptPaint we provide insight into future steerable generative tools.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and\nunpredictable seizures, necessitating accurate prediction for effective\nmanagement and patient care. Application of machine learning (ML) on\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, along with its ability to provide\nvaluable insights into brain activity during seizures, is able to make accurate\nand robust seizure prediction an indispensable component in relevant studies.\nIn this research, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of five\nmachine learning models - Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Extra Trees\n(ET), Logistic Regression (LR), and Gradient Boosting (GB) - for the prediction\nof epileptic seizures using EEG data. The dataset underwent meticulous\npreprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, outlier handling, and\noversampling, ensuring data quality and facilitating accurate model training.\nThese preprocessing techniques played a crucial role in enhancing the models'\nperformance. The results of our analysis demonstrate the performance of each\nmodel in terms of accuracy. The LR classifier achieved an accuracy of 56.95%,\nwhile GB and DT both attained 97.17% accuracy.

Our findings reveal that the ET model outperformed not only the other\nmodels in the comparative analysis but also surpassed the state-of-the-art\nresults from previous research.

    "abstract": "Neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification,\nspeech recognition, scientific analysis and many more application areas. With\nthe ever-increasing need for faster computation and lower power consumption,\ndriven by real-time systems and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, FPGAs have\nemerged as suitable devices for deep learning inference. Due to the high\ncomputational complexity and memory footprint of neural networks, various\ncompression techniques, such as pruning, quantization and knowledge\ndistillation, have been proposed in literature. Pruning sparsifies a neural\nnetwork, reducing the number of multiplications and memory. However, pruning\noften fails to capture properties of the underlying hardware, causing\nunstructured sparsity and load-balance inefficiency, thus bottlenecking\nresource improvements. We propose a hardware-centric formulation of pruning, by\nformulating it as a knapsack problem with resource-aware tensor structures. The\nprimary emphasis is on real-time inference, with latencies in the order of\n1μ\\mus, accelerated with hls4ml, an open-source framework for deep learning\ninference on FPGAs. Evaluated on a range of tasks, including real-time particle\nclassification at CERN's Large Hadron Collider and fast image classification,\nthe proposed method achieves a reduction ranging between 55% and 92% in the\nutilization of digital signal processing blocks (DSP) and up to 81% in block\nmemory (BRAM) utilization.",

    "abstract": "A significant number of machine learning models are vulnerable to model\nextraction attacks, which focus on stealing the models by using specially\ncurated queries against the target model. This task is well accomplished by\nusing part of the training data or a surrogate dataset to train a new model\nthat mimics a target model in a white-box environment. In pragmatic situations,\nhowever, the target models are trained on private datasets that are\ninaccessible to the adversary. The data-free model extraction technique\nreplaces this problem when it comes to using queries artificially curated by a\ngenerator similar to that used in Generative Adversarial Nets. We propose for\nthe first time, to the best of our knowledge, an adversary black box attack\nextending to a regression problem for predicting bounding box coordinates in\nobject detection. As part of our study, we found that defining a loss function\nand using a novel generator setup is one of the key aspects in extracting the\ntarget model. We find that the proposed model extraction method achieves\nsignificant results by using reasonable queries.

    "abstract": "Lesion segmentation of ultrasound medical images based on deep learning\ntechniques is a widely used method for diagnosing diseases. Although there is a\nlarge amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places,\nlabeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no\ndatasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the\npossibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural\nimages that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant\nfeatures that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration\nbetween ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of\npublic datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source\ndomains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,\nand there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,\nwhich may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial\ntransfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed.\nSpecifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial\ntransfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a\ncertain pair of source and target domains, which provides the possibility to\nutilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a\nsingle source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse\nknowledge from multiple source domains. In order to ensure the effectiveness of\nthe fusion and maximize the use of precious data, a multi-source domain\nindependent strategy is also proposed to improve the estimation of the target\ndomain data distribution, which further increases the learning ability of the\nmulti-source adversarial migration learning network in multiple domains.",
