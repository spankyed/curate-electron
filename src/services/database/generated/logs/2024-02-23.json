    "title": "Stacking Factorizing Partitioned Expressions in Hybrid Bayesian Network\n  Models",
    "abstract": "  Hybrid Bayesian networks (HBN) contain complex conditional probabilistic\ndistributions (CPD) specified as partitioned expressions over discrete and\ncontinuous variables. The size of these CPDs grows exponentially with the\nnumber of parent nodes when using discrete inference, resulting in significant\ninefficiency. Normally, an effective way to reduce the CPD size is to use a\nbinary factorization (BF) algorithm to decompose the statistical or arithmetic\nfunctions in the CPD by factorizing the number of connected parent nodes to\nsets of size two. However, the BF algorithm was not designed to handle\npartitioned expressions. Hence, we propose a new algorithm called stacking\nfactorization (SF) to decompose the partitioned expressions. The SF algorithm\ncreates intermediate nodes to incrementally reconstruct the densities in the\noriginal partitioned expression, allowing no more than two continuous parent\nnodes to be connected to each child node in the resulting HBN. SF can be either\nused independently or combined with the BF algorithm. We show that the SF+BF\nalgorithm significantly reduces the CPD size and contributes to lowering the\ntree-width of a model, thus improving efficiency.\n",

    "abstract": "  Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (KGs) contain additional key-value pairs,\nproviding more information about the relations. In many scenarios, the same\nrelation can have distinct key-value pairs, making the original triple fact\nmore recognizable and specific.

As the sampling steps decrease, the\ngeneration process and the role of the UNet get closer to the push-forward\ntransformations from Gaussian distribution to the target, posing a challenge\nfor the network's complexity. To address this challenge, we propose\nSkip-Tuning, a simple yet surprisingly effective training-free tuning method on\nthe skip connections.

In this work, we reduce the chances of sampling adversarial content\ninjected by malware authors by selecting correlated subsets of bytes, rather\nthan using Gaussian noise to randomize inputs like in the Computer Vision (CV)\ndomain. During training, our ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base\nclassifier to make classifications on a subset of contiguous bytes or chunk of\nbytes.

    "abstract": "  Recent advancements have highlighted the limitations of current quantum\nsystems, particularly the restricted number of qubits available on near-term\nquantum devices. This constraint greatly inhibits the range of applications\nthat can leverage quantum computers. Moreover, as the available qubits\nincrease, the computational complexity grows exponentially, posing additional\nchallenges. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use qubits efficiently and\nmitigate both present limitations and future complexities. To address this,\nexisting quantum applications attempt to integrate classical and quantum\nsystems in a hybrid framework. In this study, we concentrate on quantum deep\nlearning and introduce a collaborative classical-quantum architecture called\nco-TenQu. The classical component employs a tensor network for compression and\nfeature extraction, enabling higher-dimensional data to be encoded onto logical\nquantum circuits with limited qubits. On the quantum side, we propose a\nquantum-state-fidelity-based evaluation function to iteratively train the\nnetwork through a feedback loop between the two sides. co-TenQu has been\nimplemented and evaluated with both simulators and the IBM-Q platform. Compared\nto state-of-the-art approaches, co-TenQu enhances a classical deep neural\nnetwork by up to 41.72% in a fair setting. Additionally, it outperforms other\nquantum-based methods by up to 1.9 times and achieves similar accuracy while\nutilizing 70.59% fewer qubits.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper addresses task planning problems for language-instructed robot\nteams. Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to\napply their capabilities (e.g., mobility, manipulation, and sensing) at various\nlocations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar\nplanning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ndesign effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission\nperformance and safety guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a\nnew decentralized LLM-based planner that is capable of achieving high mission\nsuccess rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a\ndistribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP\nallows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent\nuncertainty in a decentralized fashion, enabling robots to make individual\ndecisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show,\nboth theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve\nuser-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help\nrequests. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on multi-robot home\nservice applications. We also show through comparative experiments, that our\nmethod outperforms recent centralized and decentralized multi-robot LLM-based\nplanners in terms of in terms of its ability to design correct plans. The\nadvantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with\nincreasing mission complexity and robot team size.\n",

This paper tackles two\ninterconnected issues within this realm of personalizing text-to-image\ndiffusion models. First, current personalization techniques fail to reliably\nextend to multiple concepts -- we hypothesize this to be due to the mismatch\nbetween complex scenes and simple text descriptions in the pre-training dataset\n(e.g., LAION). Second, given an image containing multiple personalized\nconcepts, there lacks a holistic metric that evaluates performance on not just\nthe degree of resemblance of personalized concepts, but also whether all\nconcepts are present in the image and whether the image accurately reflects the\noverall text description. To address these issues, we introduce Gen4Gen, a\nsemi-automated dataset creation pipeline utilizing generative models to combine\npersonalized concepts into complex compositions along with text-descriptions.\nUsing this, we create a dataset called MyCanvas, that can be used to benchmark\nthe task of multi-concept personalization. In addition, we design a\ncomprehensive metric comprising two scores (CP-CLIP and TI-CLIP) for better\nquantifying the performance of multi-concept, personalized text-to-image\ndiffusion methods.

However, current NCO methods typically require building\none model for each routing problem, which significantly hinders their practical\napplication for real-world industry problems with diverse attributes.

Extensive experiments are\nconducted on eleven VRP variants, benchmark datasets, and industry logistic\nscenarios.

    "title": "Fine-tuning CLIP Text Encoders with Two-step Paraphrasing",
    "abstract": "  Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated\nconsiderable success across various vision-language tasks, such as\ntext-to-image retrieval, where the model is required to effectively process\nnatural language input to produce an accurate visual output. However, current\nmodels still face limitations in dealing with linguistic variations in input\nqueries, such as paraphrases, making it challenging to handle a broad range of\nuser queries in real-world applications. In this study, we introduce a\nstraightforward fine-tuning approach to enhance the representations of CLIP\nmodels for paraphrases. Our approach involves a two-step paraphrase generation\nprocess, where we automatically create two categories of paraphrases from\nweb-scale image captions by leveraging large language models. Subsequently, we\nfine-tune the CLIP text encoder using these generated paraphrases while\nfreezing the image encoder. Our resulting model, which we call ParaCLIP,\nexhibits significant improvements over baseline CLIP models across various\ntasks, including paraphrased retrieval (with rank similarity scores improved by\nup to 2.0% and 5.6%), Visual Genome Relation and Attribution, as well as seven\nsemantic textual similarity tasks.\n",

    "title": "On the Duality Between Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Adversarial\n  Training",
    "abstract": "  Adversarial Training (AT), which adversarially perturb the input samples\nduring training, has been acknowledged as one of the most effective defenses\nagainst adversarial attacks, yet suffers from a fundamental tradeoff that\ninevitably decreases clean accuracy. Instead of perturbing the samples,\nSharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) perturbs the model weights during training\nto find a more flat loss landscape and improve generalization. However, as SAM\nis designed for better clean accuracy, its effectiveness in enhancing\nadversarial robustness remains unexplored. In this work, considering the\nduality between SAM and AT, we investigate the adversarial robustness derived\nfrom SAM. Intriguingly, we find that using SAM alone can improve adversarial\nrobustness. To understand this unexpected property of SAM, we first provide\nempirical and theoretical insights into how SAM can implicitly learn more\nrobust features, and conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SAM can\nimprove adversarial robustness notably without sacrificing any clean accuracy,\nshedding light on the potential of SAM to be a substitute for AT when accuracy\ncomes at a higher priority.

While diffusion models are trained to represent\nthe distribution in the training dataset, we often are more concerned with\nother properties, such as the aesthetic quality of the generated images or the\nfunctional properties of generated proteins. Diffusion models can be finetuned\nin a goal-directed way by maximizing the value of some reward function (e.g.,\nthe aesthetic quality of an image).

In\nproduction environment, VFL usually involves one task party and one data party.\nFair and economically efficient feature trading is crucial to the\ncommercialization of VFL, where the task party is considered as the data\nconsumer who buys the data party's features. However, current VFL feature\ntrading practices often price the data party's data as a whole and assume\ntransactions occur prior to the performing VFL. Neglecting the performance\ngains resulting from traded features may lead to underpayment and overpayment\nissues. In this study, we propose a bargaining-based feature trading approach\nin VFL to encourage economically efficient transactions. Our model incorporates\nperformance gain-based pricing, taking into account the revenue-based\noptimization objectives of both parties. We analyze the proposed bargaining\nmodel under perfect and imperfect performance information settings, proving the\nexistence of an equilibrium that optimizes the parties' objectives. Moreover,\nwe develop performance gain estimation-based bargaining strategies for\nimperfect performance information scenarios and discuss potential security\nissues and solutions.

Despite the advancements in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which offer leading-edge performance,\ntheir applicability in large-scale, varied, and ambiguous retrieval scenarios\nis constrained by significant computational demands and the generation of\ninjective embeddings. This paper introduces the Text2Pic Swift framework,\ntailored for efficient and robust retrieval of images corresponding to\nextensive textual descriptions in sizable datasets. The framework employs a\ntwo-tier approach: the initial Entity-based Ranking (ER) stage addresses the\nambiguity inherent in lengthy text queries through a\nmultiple-queries-to-multiple-targets strategy, effectively narrowing down\npotential candidates for subsequent analysis. Following this, the Summary-based\nRe-ranking (SR) stage further refines these selections based on concise query\nsummaries.

    "abstract": "  We consider a sequential decision making task, where the goal is to optimize\nan unknown function without evaluating parameters that violate an a~priori\nunknown (safety) constraint. A common approach is to place a Gaussian process\nprior on the unknown functions and allow evaluations only in regions that are\nsafe with high probability. Most current methods rely on a discretization of\nthe domain and cannot be directly extended to the continuous case. Moreover,\nthe way in which they exploit regularity assumptions about the constraint\nintroduces an additional critical hyperparameter. In this paper, we propose an\ninformation-theoretic safe exploration criterion that directly exploits the GP\nposterior to identify the most informative safe parameters to evaluate. The\ncombination of this exploration criterion with a well known Bayesian\noptimization acquisition function yields a novel safe Bayesian optimization\nselection criterion. Our approach is naturally applicable to continuous domains\nand does not require additional explicit hyperparameters. We theoretically\nanalyze the method and show that we do not violate the safety constraint with\nhigh probability and that we learn about the value of the safe optimum up to\narbitrary precision. Empirical evaluations demonstrate improved data-efficiency\nand scalability.\n",

In this study, we\nfirst introduce a probabilistic notion of T2I DMs' robustness; and then\nestablish an efficient framework, ProTIP, to evaluate it with statistical\nguarantees.

We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot's\nstate space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements,\nresulting in the equivariance of the robot's equations of motion and optimal\ncontrol policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and\npreviously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant\nimplications for both data-driven and analytical methods used in modeling,\ncontrol, estimation and design in robotics. For data-driven methods, we\ndemonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and\ngeneralization of machine learning models through data augmentation, or by\napplying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model's architecture.

    "title": "Deep Networks Always Grok and Here is Why",
    "abstract": "  Grokking, or delayed generalization, is a phenomenon where generalization in\na deep neural network (DNN) occurs long after achieving near zero training\nerror. Previous studies have reported the occurrence of grokking in specific\ncontrolled settings, such as DNNs initialized with large-norm parameters or\ntransformers trained on algorithmic datasets. We demonstrate that grokking is\nactually much more widespread and materializes in a wide range of practical\nsettings, such as training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on CIFAR10\nor a Resnet on Imagenette. We introduce the new concept of delayed robustness,\nwhereby a DNN groks adversarial examples and becomes robust, long after\ninterpolation and/or generalization. We develop an analytical explanation for\nthe emergence of both delayed generalization and delayed robustness based on a\nnew measure of the local complexity of a DNN's input-output mapping. Our local\ncomplexity measures the density of the so-called 'linear regions' (aka, spline\npartition regions) that tile the DNN input space, and serves as a utile\nprogress measure for training. We provide the first evidence that for\nclassification problems, the linear regions undergo a phase transition during\ntraining whereafter they migrate away from the training samples (making the DNN\nmapping smoother there) and towards the decision boundary (making the DNN\nmapping less smooth there). Grokking occurs post phase transition as a robust\npartition of the input space emerges thanks to the linearization of the DNN\nmapping around the training points.

    "title": "Foundation Policies with Hilbert Representations",
    "abstract": "  Unsupervised and self-supervised objectives, such as next token prediction,\nhave enabled pre-training generalist models from large amounts of unlabeled\ndata. In reinforcement learning (RL), however, finding a truly general and\nscalable unsupervised pre-training objective for generalist policies from\noffline data remains a major open question. While a number of methods have been\nproposed to enable generic self-supervised RL, based on principles such as\ngoal-conditioned RL, behavioral cloning, and unsupervised skill learning, such\nmethods remain limited in terms of either the diversity of the discovered\nbehaviors, the need for high-quality demonstration data, or the lack of a clear\nprompting or adaptation mechanism for downstream tasks. In this work, we\npropose a novel unsupervised framework to pre-train generalist policies that\ncapture diverse, optimal, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline data\nsuch that they can be quickly adapted to any arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot\nmanner. Our key insight is to learn a structured representation that preserves\nthe temporal structure of the underlying environment, and then to span this\nlearned latent space with directional movements, which enables various\nzero-shot policy \"prompting\" schemes for downstream tasks. Through our\nexperiments on simulated robotic locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, we\nshow that our unsupervised policies can solve goal-conditioned and general RL\ntasks in a zero-shot fashion, even often outperforming prior methods designed\nspecifically for each setting.

    "title": "Fast Adversarial Attacks on Language Models In One GPU Minute",
    "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce a novel class of fast, beam search-based\nadversarial attack (BEAST) for Language Models (LMs). BEAST employs\ninterpretable parameters, enabling attackers to balance between attack speed,\nsuccess rate, and the readability of adversarial prompts. The computational\nefficiency of BEAST facilitates us to investigate its applications on LMs for\njailbreaking, eliciting hallucinations, and privacy attacks. Our gradient-free\ntargeted attack can jailbreak aligned LMs with high attack success rates within\none minute. For instance, BEAST can jailbreak Vicuna-7B-v1.5 under one minute\nwith a success rate of 89% when compared to a gradient-based baseline that\ntakes over an hour to achieve 70% success rate using a single Nvidia RTX A6000\n48GB GPU. Additionally, we discover a unique outcome wherein our untargeted\nattack induces hallucinations in LM chatbots. Through human evaluations, we\nfind that our untargeted attack causes Vicuna-7B-v1.5 to produce ~15% more\nincorrect outputs when compared to LM outputs in the absence of our attack. We\nalso learn that 22% of the time, BEAST causes Vicuna to generate outputs that\nare not relevant to the original prompt. Further, we use BEAST to generate\nadversarial prompts in a few seconds that can boost the performance of existing\nmembership inference attacks for LMs. We believe that our fast attack, BEAST,\nhas the potential to accelerate research in LM security and privacy.

    "abstract": "  The rapid evolution of automated vehicles (AVs) has the potential to provide\nsafer, more efficient, and comfortable travel options. However, these systems\nface challenges regarding reliability in complex driving scenarios. Recent\nexplainable AV architectures neglect crucial information related to inherent\nuncertainties while providing explanations for actions. To overcome such\nchallenges, our study builds upon the \"object-induced\" model approach that\nprioritizes the role of objects in scenes for decision-making and integrates\nuncertainty assessment into the decision-making process using an evidential\ndeep learning paradigm with a Beta prior. Additionally, we explore several\nadvanced training strategies guided by uncertainty, including\nuncertainty-guided data reweighting and augmentation. Leveraging the BDD-OIA\ndataset, our findings underscore that the model, through these enhancements,\nnot only offers a clearer comprehension of AV decisions and their underlying\nreasoning but also surpasses existing baselines across a broad range of\nscenarios.\n",

Given the\nlatest major developments in generative AI, especially Large Language Models\n(LLMs), it is very compelling to rigorously study the utility of LLMs in\ngenerating such meta-reviews in an academic peer-review setting.

    "abstract": "  Causal learning is a fundamental problem in statistics and science, offering\ninsights into predicting the effects of unseen treatments on a system. Despite\nrecent advances in this topic, most existing causal discovery algorithms\noperate under two key assumptions: (i) the underlying graph is acyclic, and\n(ii) the available data is complete. These assumptions can be problematic as\nmany real-world systems contain feedback loops (e.g., biological systems), and\npractical scenarios frequently involve missing data. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework, named MissNODAGS, for learning cyclic causal graphs from\npartially missing data. Under the additive noise model, MissNODAGS learns the\ncausal graph by alternating between imputing the missing data and maximizing\nthe expected log-likelihood of the visible part of the data in each training\nstep, following the principles of the expectation-maximization (EM) framework.\nThrough synthetic experiments and real-world single-cell perturbation data, we\ndemonstrate improved performance when compared to using state-of-the-art\nimputation techniques followed by causal learning on partially missing\ninterventional data.\n",

    "abstract": "  As machine- and AI-generated content proliferates, protecting the\nintellectual property of generative models has become imperative, yet verifying\ndata ownership poses formidable challenges, particularly in cases of\nunauthorized reuse of generated data. The challenge of verifying data ownership\nis further amplified by using Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), which\noften functions as a black-box system.\n  Our work is dedicated to detecting data reuse from even an individual sample.\nTraditionally, watermarking has been leveraged to detect AI-generated content.\nHowever, unlike watermarking techniques that embed additional information as\ntriggers into models or generated content, potentially compromising output\nquality, our approach identifies latent fingerprints inherently present within\nthe outputs through re-generation. We propose an explainable verification\nprocedure that attributes data ownership through re-generation, and further\namplifies these fingerprints in the generative models through iterative data\nre-generation. This methodology is theoretically grounded and demonstrates\nviability and robustness using recent advanced text and image generative\nmodels. Our methodology is significant as it goes beyond protecting the\nintellectual property of APIs and addresses important issues such as the spread\nof misinformation and academic misconduct.

    "abstract": "  Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) refers to a class of techniques that\naim to prevent RL algorithms from violating constraints in the process of\ndecision-making and exploration during trial and error. In this paper, a novel\nmodel-free Safe RL algorithm, formulated based on the multi-objective policy\noptimization framework is introduced where the policy is optimized towards\noptimality and safety, simultaneously. The optimality is achieved by the\nenvironment reward function that is subsequently shaped using a safety critic.\nThe advantage of the Safety Optimized RL (SORL) algorithm compared to the\ntraditional Safe RL algorithms is that it omits the need to constrain the\npolicy search space. This allows SORL to find a natural tradeoff between safety\nand optimality without compromising the performance in terms of either safety\nor optimality due to strict search space constraints. Through our theoretical\nanalysis of SORL, we propose a condition for SORL's converged policy to\nguarantee safety and then use it to introduce an aggressiveness parameter that\nallows for fine-tuning the mentioned tradeoff. The experimental results\nobtained in seven different robotic environments indicate a considerable\nreduction in the number of safety violations along with higher, or competitive,\npolicy returns, in comparison to six different state-of-the-art Safe RL\nmethods.

Motivated by this, we introduce our CLIP-Guided Decoding (CGD)\napproach, a straightforward but effective training-free approach to reduce\nobject hallucination at decoding time. CGD uses CLIP to guide the model's\ndecoding process by enhancing visual grounding of generated text with the\nimage.
