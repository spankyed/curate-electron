    "abstract": "  Recent advancements in large foundation models have remarkably enhanced our\nunderstanding of sensory information in open-world environments. In leveraging\nthe power of foundation models, it is crucial for AI research to pivot away\nfrom excessive reductionism and toward an emphasis on systems that function as\ncohesive wholes. Specifically, we emphasize developing Agent AI -- an embodied\nsystem that integrates large foundation models into agent actions. The emerging\nfield of Agent AI spans a wide range of existing embodied and agent-based\nmultimodal interactions, including robotics, gaming, and healthcare systems,\netc. In this paper, we propose a novel large action model to achieve embodied\nintelligent behavior, the Agent Foundation Model. On top of this idea, we\ndiscuss how agent AI exhibits remarkable capabilities across a variety of\ndomains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition.\nFurthermore, we discuss the potential of Agent AI from an interdisciplinary\nperspective, underscoring AI cognition and consciousness within scientific\ndiscourse. We believe that those discussions serve as a basis for future\nresearch directions and encourage broader societal engagement.\n",

    "abstract": "  Given the accelerating progress of vision and language modeling, accurate\nevaluation of machine-generated image captions remains critical. In order to\nevaluate captions more closely to human preferences, metrics need to\ndiscriminate between captions of varying quality and content. However,\nconventional metrics fail short of comparing beyond superficial matches of\nwords or embedding similarities; thus, they still need improvement. This paper\npresents VisCE$^2$, a vision language model-based caption evaluation method.\nOur method focuses on visual context, which refers to the detailed content of\nimages, including objects, attributes, and relationships. By extracting and\norganizing them into a structured format, we replace the human-written\nreferences with visual contexts and help VLMs better understand the image,\nenhancing evaluation performance. Through meta-evaluation on multiple datasets,\nwe validated that VisCE$^2$ outperforms the conventional pre-trained metrics in\ncapturing caption quality and demonstrates superior consistency with human\njudgment.\n",

While\nnumerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited\nresearch has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given\nexplicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that\nare unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose\nto perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To\nconstrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the\noriginal optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the\nBoltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data\ndistribution learned by the diffusion model. To enhance sampling efficiency, we\npropose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for\nwarm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction.\nTheoretical analysis shows that the initial stage results in a distribution\nfocused on feasible solutions, thereby providing a better initialization for\nthe later stage. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six\nreal-world black-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective optimization\ndataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with\nprevious state-of-the-art baselines.\n",

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod that bridge between LLM representations and human cognition signals to\nevaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing.

A potentially valuable by-product of these\nmethods is the large-scale silver standard data, i.e., pseudo-labeled data by\nthe off-the-shelf models of other NLP tasks. However, there is no further\ninvestigation into the use of these data.

Although recent methods\nwere proposed to select and evict unimportant KV pairs from the cache to reduce\nmemory consumption, the potential ramifications of eviction on the generative\nprocess are yet to be thoroughly examined. In this paper, we examine the\ndetrimental impact of cache eviction and observe that unforeseen risks arise as\nthe information contained in the KV pairs is exhaustively discarded, resulting\nin safety breaches, hallucinations, and context loss. Surprisingly, we find\nthat preserving even a small amount of information contained in the evicted KV\npairs via reduced precision quantization substantially recovers the incurred\ndegradation. On the other hand, we observe that the important KV pairs must be\nkept at a relatively higher precision to safeguard the generation quality.\nMotivated by these observations, we propose \\textit{Mixed-precision KV\ncache}~(MiKV), a reliable cache compression method that simultaneously\npreserves the context details by retaining the evicted KV pairs in\nlow-precision and ensure generation quality by keeping the important KV pairs\nin high-precision.

Consequently, distillation through imitation of\nteacher responses has emerged as a popular technique to transfer knowledge from\nLLMs to more accessible, Small Language Models (SLMs). While this works well\nfor simpler tasks, there is a substantial performance gap on tasks requiring\nintricate language comprehension and creativity, such as humor generation. We\nhypothesize that this gap may stem from the fact that creative tasks might be\nhard to learn by imitation alone and explore whether an approach, involving\nsupplementary guidance from the teacher, could yield higher performance. To\naddress this, we study the effect of assigning a dual role to the LLM - as a\n\"teacher\" generating data, as well as a \"critic\" evaluating the student's\nperformance. Our experiments on humor generation reveal that the incorporation\nof feedback significantly narrows the performance gap between SLMs and their\nlarger counterparts compared to merely relying on imitation.

    "abstract": "  Large language models exhibit societal biases associated with demographic\ninformation, including race, gender, and others. Endowing such language models\nwith personalities based on demographic data can enable generating opinions\nthat align with those of humans. Building on this idea, we propose \"random\nsilicon sampling,\" a method to emulate the opinions of the human population\nsub-group. Our study analyzed 1) a language model that generates the survey\nresponses that correspond with a human group based solely on its demographic\ndistribution and 2) the applicability of our methodology across various\ndemographic subgroups and thematic questions. Through random silicon sampling\nand using only group-level demographic information, we discovered that language\nmodels can generate response distributions that are remarkably similar to the\nactual U.S. public opinion polls. Moreover, we found that the replicability of\nlanguage models varies depending on the demographic group and topic of the\nquestion, and this can be attributed to inherent societal biases in the models.\nOur findings demonstrate the feasibility of mirroring a group's opinion using\nonly demographic distribution and elucidate the effect of social biases in\nlanguage models on such simulations.\n",

    "abstract": "  Transfer learning is a topic of significant interest in recent deep learning\nresearch because it enables faster convergence and improved performance on new\ntasks. While the performance of transfer learning depends on the similarity of\nthe source data to the target data, it is costly to train a model on a large\nnumber of datasets. Therefore, pretrained models are generally blindly selected\nwith the hope that they will achieve good performance on the given task. To\ntackle such suboptimality of the pretrained models, we propose an efficient and\nadaptive transfer learning scheme through dataset-conditioned pretrained\nweights sampling. Specifically, we use a latent diffusion model with a\nvariational autoencoder that can reconstruct the neural network weights, to\nlearn the distribution of a set of pretrained weights conditioned on each\ndataset for transfer learning on unseen datasets. By learning the distribution\nof a neural network on a variety pretrained models, our approach enables\nadaptive sampling weights for unseen datasets achieving faster convergence and\nreaching competitive performance.\n",

    "abstract": "  Large Language Model (LLM) systems are inherently compositional, with\nindividual LLM serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects\nsuch as plugins, sandbox, and so on. Along with the great potential, there are\nalso increasing concerns over the security of such probabilistic intelligent\nsystems. However, existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual\nLLM, but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with\nother objects (e.g., Frontend, Webtool, Sandbox, and so on). In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the security of LLM systems, instead of focusing on the\nindividual LLMs. To do so, we build on top of the information flow and\nformulate the security of LLM systems as constraints on the alignment of the\ninformation flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects. Based on this\nconstruction and the unique probabilistic nature of LLM, the attack surface of\nthe LLM system can be decomposed into three key components: (1) multi-layer\nsecurity analysis, (2) analysis of the existence of constraints, and (3)\nanalysis of the robustness of these constraints. To ground this new attack\nsurface, we propose a multi-layer and multi-step approach and apply it to the\nstate-of-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4. Our investigation exposes several\nsecurity issues, not just within the LLM model itself but also in its\nintegration with other components. We found that although the OpenAI GPT4 has\ndesigned numerous safety constraints to improve its safety features, these\nsafety constraints are still vulnerable to attackers. To further demonstrate\nthe real-world threats of our discovered vulnerabilities, we construct an\nend-to-end attack where an adversary can illicitly acquire the user's chat\nhistory, all without the need to manipulate the user's input or gain direct\naccess to OpenAI GPT4.

One of the main problems considered is the Mission Planning for\nmultiple UAVs, where a solution plan must be found satisfying the different\nconstraints of the problem. This problem has multiple variables that must be\noptimized simultaneously, such as the makespan, the cost of the mission or the\nrisk. Therefore, the problem has a lot of possible optimal solutions, and the\noperator must select the final solution to be executed among them. In order to\nreduce the workload of the operator in this decision process, a Decision\nSupport System (DSS) becomes necessary. In this work, a DSS consisting of\nranking and filtering systems, which order and reduce the optimal solutions,\nhas been designed. With regard to the ranking system, a wide range of\nMulti-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, including some fuzzy MCDM, are\ncompared on a multi-UAV mission planning scenario, in order to study which\nmethod could fit better in a multi-UAV decision support system. Expert\noperators have evaluated the solutions returned, and the results show, on the\none hand, that fuzzy methods generally achieve better average scores, and on\nthe other, that all of the tested methods perform better when the preferences\nof the operators are biased towards a specific variable, and worse when their\npreferences are balanced. For the filtering system, a similarity function based\non the proximity of the solutions has been designed, and on top of that, a\nthreshold is tuned empirically to decide how to filter solutions without losing\nmuch of the hypervolume of the space of solutions.\n",

However, they often face challenges obtaining\nspecific joint action sequences to reach successful states in long-horizon\ntasks. To address this limitation, we propose Imagine, Initialize, and Explore\n(IIE), a novel method that offers a promising solution for efficient\nmulti-agent exploration in complex scenarios. IIE employs a transformer model\nto imagine how the agents reach a critical state that can influence each\nother's transition functions. Then, we initialize the environment at this state\nusing a simulator before the exploration phase. We formulate the imagination as\na sequence modeling problem, where the states, observations, prompts, actions,\nand rewards are predicted autoregressively. The prompt consists of\ntimestep-to-go, return-to-go, influence value, and one-shot demonstration,\nspecifying the desired state and trajectory as well as guiding the action\ngeneration.

    "abstract": "  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance\nacross various tasks. However, the latency of inference and the large GPU\nmemory consumption of LLMs restrict their deployment performance. Recently,\nthere have been some efficient attempts to quantize LLMs, yet inference with\nlarge batch size or long sequence still has the issue of being compute-bound.\nFine-grained quantization methods have showcased their proficiency in achieving\nlow-bit quantization for LLMs, while requiring FP16 data type for linear layer\ncomputations, which is time-consuming when dealing with large batch size or\nlong sequence. In this paper, we introduce a method called FlattenQuant, which\nsignificantly reduces the maximum value of the tensor by flattening the large\nchannels in the tensor, to achieve low bit per-tensor quantization with minimal\naccuracy loss. Our experiments show that FlattenQuant can directly use 4 bits\nto achieve 48.29% of the linear layer calculation in LLMs, with the remaining\nlayers using 8 bits. The 4-bit matrix multiplication introduced in the\nFlattenQuant method can effectively address the compute-bound caused by large\nmatrix calculation. Our work achieves up to 2$\\times$ speedup and 2.3$\\times$\nmemory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy.\n",

Instead, we propose to leverage\nthe symmetry for sample efficiency by augmenting the training data and\nconstructing auxiliary losses to force the agent to adhere to the symmetry.\nResults in simulation with five different symmetric peg shapes show that our\nproposed agent can be comparable to or even outperform a state-based agent.

While the demographic parity (DP) notion has been frequently used to\nmeasure a model's fairness in training fair classifiers, several studies in the\nliterature suggest potential impacts of enforcing DP in fair learning\nalgorithms. In this work, we analytically study the effect of standard DP-based\nregularization methods on the conditional distribution of the predicted label\ngiven the sensitive attribute. Our analysis shows that an imbalanced training\ndataset with a non-uniform distribution of the sensitive attribute could lead\nto a classification rule biased toward the sensitive attribute outcome holding\nthe majority of training data. To control such inductive biases in DP-based\nfair learning, we propose a sensitive attribute-based distributionally robust\noptimization (SA-DRO) method improving robustness against the marginal\ndistribution of the sensitive attribute. Finally, we present several numerical\nresults on the application of DP-based learning methods to standard centralized\nand distributed learning problems.

The key reason is that the\ntraining of LLMs does not clearly make LLMs learn how to utilize input\nretrieved texts with varied quality. In this paper, we propose a novel\nperspective that considers the role of LLMs in RAG as ``Information Refiner'',\nwhich means that regardless of correctness, completeness, or usefulness of\nretrieved texts, LLMs can consistently integrate knowledge within the retrieved\ntexts and model parameters to generate the texts that are more concise,\naccurate, and complete than the retrieved texts. To this end, we propose an\ninformation refinement training method named InFO-RAG that optimizes LLMs for\nRAG in an unsupervised manner. InFO-RAG is low-cost and general across various\ntasks. Extensive experiments on zero-shot prediction of 11 datasets in diverse\ntasks including Question Answering, Slot-Filling, Language Modeling, Dialogue,\nand Code Generation show that InFO-RAG improves the performance of LLaMA2 by an\naverage of 9.39\\% relative points.

    "abstract": "  Recently, retrieval augmentation and tool augmentation have demonstrated a\nremarkable capability to expand the internal memory boundaries of language\nmodels (LMs) by providing external context. However, internal memory and\nexternal context inevitably clash, leading to knowledge conflicts within LMs.\nIn this paper, we aim to interpret the mechanism of knowledge conflicts through\nthe lens of information flow, and then mitigate conflicts by precise\ninterventions at the pivotal point. We find there are some attention heads with\nopposite effects in the later layers, where memory heads can recall knowledge\nfrom internal memory, and context heads can retrieve knowledge from external\ncontext. Moreover, we reveal that the pivotal point at which knowledge\nconflicts emerge in LMs is the integration of inconsistent information flows by\nmemory heads and context heads. Inspired by the insights, we propose a novel\nmethod called Pruning Head via PatH PatcHing (PH3), which can efficiently\nmitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning conflicting attention heads without\nupdating model parameters. PH3 can flexibly control eight LMs to use internal\nmemory ($\\uparrow$ 44.0%) or external context ($\\uparrow$ 38.5%). Moreover, PH3\ncan also improve the performance of LMs on open-domain QA tasks.

Few-shot-learning (FSL)\nclassification is challenging in itself because a model has to identify images\nthat belong to classes previously unseen during training. Therefore, a warped\nand non-typical query or support image during testing can make it even more\nchallenging for a model to predict correctly. In our work, to increase the\nchance of correct prediction during testing, we aim to rectify the test input\nof a trained FSL model by generating new samples of the tested classes through\nimage-to-image translation. An FSL model is usually trained on classes with\nsufficient samples, and then tested on classes with few-shot samples. Our\nproposed method first captures the style or shape of the test image, and then\nidentifies a suitable trained class sample. It then transfers the style or\nshape of the test image to the train-class images for generation of more\ntest-class samples, before performing classification based on a set of\ngenerated samples instead of just one sample. Our method has potential in\nempowering a trained FSL model to score higher during the testing phase without\nany extra training nor dataset. According to our experiments, by augmenting the\nsupport set with just 1 additional generated sample, we can achieve around 2%\nimprovement for trained FSL models on datasets consisting of either animal\nfaces or traffic signs.

However, the evaluation of\nnon-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal\ndecisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is equally\nvital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is\nlittle work dedicated to assessing ADSs' optimal decision-making performance\ndue to the lack of corresponding oracles and the difficulty in generating\nscenarios with non-optimal decisions. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the\ndecision-making quality of an ADS and propose the first method for detecting\nnon-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not compute optimal\npaths for AVs. Firstly, to deal with the oracle problem, we propose a novel\nmetamorphic relation (MR) aimed at exposing violations of optimal decisions.\nThe MR identifies the property that the ADS should retain optimal decisions\nwhen the optimal path remains unaffected by non-invasive changes. Subsequently,\nwe develop a new framework, Decictor, designed to generate NoDSs efficiently.\nDecictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, MR Check, and\nFeedback. The Non-invasive Mutation ensures that the original optimal path in\nthe mutated scenarios is not affected, while the MR Check is responsible for\ndetermining whether non-optimal decisions are made. To enhance the\neffectiveness of identifying NoDSs, we design a feedback metric that combines\nboth spatial and temporal aspects of the AV's movement. We evaluate Decictor on\nBaidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results\nvalidate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal decisions of\nADSs. Our work provides valuable and original insights into evaluating the\nnon-safety-critical performance of ADSs.\n",

While\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) shows promise in aligning\nLLMs, its reliance on scalar rewards often limits its ability to capture\ndiverse user preferences in real-world applications. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce the Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) framework.\nUnlike the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA incorporates multi-objective reward modeling\nto represent diverse preference profiles. Additionally, DPA models user\npreferences as directions (i.e., unit vectors) in the reward space to achieve\nuser-dependent preference control.

To solve this problem,\nresearchers treat the mapping from data to expressions as a translation\nproblem.

In underparameterized regimes, we illustrate how the cross-entropy\nloss can lead to suboptimal memorization schemes. Finally, we assess the\nvalidity of our findings on small Transformer models.\n",

    "title": "Unveiling Privacy, Memorization, and Input Curvature Links",
    "abstract": "  Deep Neural Nets (DNNs) have become a pervasive tool for solving many\nemerging problems. However, they tend to overfit to and memorize the training\nset. Memorization is of keen interest since it is closely related to several\nconcepts such as generalization, noisy learning, and privacy. To study\nmemorization, Feldman (2019) proposed a formal score, however its computational\nrequirements limit its practical use. Recent research has shown empirical\nevidence linking input loss curvature (measured by the trace of the loss\nHessian w.r.t inputs) and memorization. It was shown to be ~3 orders of\nmagnitude more efficient than calculating the memorization score. However,\nthere is a lack of theoretical understanding linking memorization with input\nloss curvature. In this paper, we not only investigate this connection but also\nextend our analysis to establish theoretical links between differential\nprivacy, memorization, and input loss curvature. First, we derive an upper\nbound on memorization characterized by both differential privacy and input loss\ncurvature. Second, we present a novel insight showing that input loss curvature\nis upper-bounded by the differential privacy parameter. Our theoretical\nfindings are further empirically validated using deep models on CIFAR and\nImageNet datasets, showing a strong correlation between our theoretical\npredictions and results observed in practice.\n",

    "title": "Learning with Language-Guided State Abstractions",
    "abstract": "  We describe a framework for using natural language to design state\nabstractions for imitation learning. Generalizable policy learning in\nhigh-dimensional observation spaces is facilitated by well-designed state\nrepresentations, which can surface important features of an environment and\nhide irrelevant ones. These state representations are typically manually\nspecified, or derived from other labor-intensive labeling procedures. Our\nmethod, LGA (language-guided abstraction), uses a combination of natural\nlanguage supervision and background knowledge from language models (LMs) to\nautomatically build state representations tailored to unseen tasks. In LGA, a\nuser first provides a (possibly incomplete) description of a target task in\nnatural language; next, a pre-trained LM translates this task description into\na state abstraction function that masks out irrelevant features; finally, an\nimitation policy is trained using a small number of demonstrations and\nLGA-generated abstract states. Experiments on simulated robotic tasks show that\nLGA yields state abstractions similar to those designed by humans, but in a\nfraction of the time, and that these abstractions improve generalization and\nrobustness in the presence of spurious correlations and ambiguous\nspecifications. We illustrate the utility of the learned abstractions on mobile\nmanipulation tasks with a Spot robot.\n",

    "abstract": "  In recent years, the notion of federated learning (FL) has led to the new\nparadigm of distributed artificial intelligence (AI) with privacy preservation.\nHowever, most current FL systems suffer from data privacy issues due to the\nrequirement of a trusted third party. Although some previous works introduce\ndifferential privacy to protect the data, however, it may also significantly\ndeteriorate the model performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel\ndecentralized collaborative AI framework, named Auditable Homomorphic-based\nDecentralised Collaborative AI (AerisAI), to improve security with homomorphic\nencryption and fine-grained differential privacy. Our proposed AerisAI directly\naggregates the encrypted parameters with a blockchain-based smart contract to\nget rid of the need of a trusted third party. We also propose a brand-new\nconcept for eliminating the negative impacts of differential privacy for model\nperformance. Moreover, the proposed AerisAI also provides the broadcast-aware\ngroup key management based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption\n(CPABE) to achieve fine-grained access control based on different service-level\nagreements. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of the proposed AerisAI as\nwell as the functionality comparison with the other baselines. We also conduct\nextensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. The\nexperimental results indicate that our proposed AerisAI significantly\noutperforms the other state-of-the-art baselines.\n",

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we present the Foundation Model for the Montreal Capacitated\nVehicle Routing Problem (FM-MCVRP), a novel Deep Learning (DL) model that\napproximates high-quality solutions to a variant of the Capacitated Vehicle\nRouting Problem (CVRP) that characterizes many real-world applications. The\nso-called Montreal Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MCVRP), first formally\ndescribed by Bengio et al. (2021), is defined on a fixed and finite graph,\nwhich is analogous to a city. Each MCVRP instance is essentially the sub-graph\nconnecting a randomly sampled subset of the nodes in the fixed graph, which\nrepresent a set of potential addresses in a real-world delivery problem on a\ngiven day. Our work exploits this problem structure to frame the MCVRP as an\nanalogous Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. Specifically, we leverage a\nTransformer architecture embedded in a Large Language Model (LLM) framework to\ntrain our model in a supervised manner on computationally inexpensive,\nsub-optimal MCVRP solutions obtained algorithmically. Through comprehensive\ncomputational experiments, we show that FM-MCVRP produces better MCVRP\nsolutions than the training data and generalizes to larger sized problem\ninstances not seen during training. Even when compared to near-optimal\nsolutions from state-of-the-art heuristics, FM-MCVRP yields competitive results\ndespite being trained on inferior data. For instance, for 400-customer\nproblems, FM-MCVRP solutions on average fall within 2% of the benchmark. Our\nresults further demonstrate that unlike prior works in the literature, FM-MCVRP\nis a unified model, which performs consistently and reliably on a range of\nproblem instance sizes and parameter values such as the vehicle capacity.\n",

    "abstract": "  In recent years, with the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNN),\nmore and more graph datasets have been published for GNN tasks. However, when\nan upstream data owner publishes graph data, there are often many privacy\nconcerns, because many real-world graph data contain sensitive information like\nperson's friend list. Differential privacy (DP) is a common method to protect\nprivacy, but due to the complex topological structure of graph data, applying\nDP on graphs often affects the message passing and aggregation of GNN models,\nleading to a decrease in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngraph edge protection framework, graph publisher (GraphPub), which can protect\ngraph topology while ensuring that the availability of data is basically\nunchanged. Through reverse learning and the encoder-decoder mechanism, we\nsearch for some false edges that do not have a large negative impact on the\naggregation of node features, and use them to replace some real edges. The\nmodified graph will be published, which is difficult to distinguish between\nreal and false data. Sufficient experiments prove that our framework achieves\nmodel accuracy close to the original graph with an extremely low privacy\nbudget.\n",

    "abstract": "  Understanding the structure and dynamics of scientific research, i.e., the\nscience of science (SciSci), has become an important area of research in order\nto address imminent questions including how scholars interact to advance\nscience, how disciplines are related and evolve, and how research impact can be\nquantified and predicted. Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis\nof citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been\nemployed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using\nparametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a\nlatent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in\nterms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent\nexample of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad\nonly has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently\npropose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such\nsingle-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact\nSingle-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The \\textsc{\\modelabbrev} model\ncharacterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model\nin which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the\ntime-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations\nfor assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several\nreal citation networks finding that the DISEE well reconciles static latent\ndistance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact\nassessments.\n",

    "abstract": "  Multimodal pretraining has emerged as an effective strategy for the trinity\nof goals of representation learning in autonomous robots: 1) extracting both\nlocal and global task progression information; 2) enforcing temporal\nconsistency of visual representation; 3) capturing trajectory-level language\ngrounding. Most existing methods approach these via separate objectives, which\noften reach sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a universal\nunified objective that can simultaneously extract meaningful task progression\ninformation from image sequences and seamlessly align them with language\ninstructions. We discover that via implicit preferences, where a visual\ntrajectory inherently aligns better with its corresponding language instruction\nthan mismatched pairs, the popular Bradley-Terry model can transform into\nrepresentation learning through proper reward reparameterizations. The resulted\nframework, DecisionNCE, mirrors an InfoNCE-style objective but is distinctively\ntailored for decision-making tasks, providing an embodied representation\nlearning framework that elegantly extracts both local and global task\nprogression features, with temporal consistency enforced through implicit time\ncontrastive learning, while ensuring trajectory-level instruction grounding via\nmultimodal joint encoding. Evaluation on both simulated and real robots\ndemonstrates that DecisionNCE effectively facilitates diverse downstream policy\nlearning tasks, offering a versatile solution for unified representation and\nreward learning.

On one hand, coordination among sources is\nfacilitated by distributed, privacy-minded processing at multiple locations,\nwhereas on the other hand, it also creates exogenous data arrival paths for\nadversaries that can lead to cyber-physical attacks amongst other reliability\nissues in the communication layer. This long-standing problem necessitates new\nintrinsic ways of exchanging information between converters through power lines\nto optimize the system's control performance. Going beyond the existing power\nand data co-transfer technologies that are limited by efficiency and\nscalability concerns, this paper proposes neuromorphic learning to implant\ncommunicative features using spiking neural networks (SNNs) at each node, which\nis trained collaboratively in an online manner simply using the power exchanges\nbetween the nodes.
